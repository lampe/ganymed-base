### Ganymed CSS Framework
!!!! THIS IS STILL A PRE ALPHA VERY EARLY TEST !!!!

!!!!!!!! DONT USE IS IN ANY PRODUCTION APP !!!!!!!!

## Goal:
Build a modular CSS Framework that works with Meteor.
The basic idea is that you dont need things like Forms or Tables in some Project so why load them if you will never use them?
So just add the Ganymed Base and the Components that you need.

## plans for 0.1.0:
- Implent a good base System
- Implent a good grid
- Think about how to make it modular in a nice way
- Test Test Test !
- add some CSS Utils like: center, hidden, right, left etc..
